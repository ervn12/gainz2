### What I learned

As I continue to build on the app, I've learned what tasks need to be prioritized. I'm currently working on the structure of the app and making sure the backend and frontend are fully functional.

### Continued development

I am currently creating a page where users will be able to check off the workouts they've completed and allow them to enter the weight, reps and sets completed for an individual workout and have them stored in the database.
